=============================
Docker Introduction :-
	1. Docker is a container management service.
	2. Docker used to develop, ship and run application anywhere.
	3. Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.
	4. The initial release of Docker was in March 2013.
	5. Docker container are lightweight alternatives to virtual machines and it uses the host OS.
	6. We do not have to pre allocate any RAM in containers

Problems before docker :-
	An application works in developers laptop but not in testing & production environment. This is due to difference in computing environment between dev, test & prod.

	When we run multiple microservices there we need multiple VM so removing these VM we need container over same VM with the help of Docker.

=============================
Features of Docker :-
	1. Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the operating system via containers.
	2. With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.
	3. You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines and even on the cloud.
	4. Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.

==============================
Components of Docker :-
	Docker has the following components
	1. Docker for Mac
	2. Docker for Linux
	3. Docker for Windows
	4. Docker Engine − It is used for building Docker images and creating Docker containers.
	5. Docker Hub − This is the registry which is used to host various Docker images.
	6. Docker Compose − This is used to define applications using multiple Docker containers.

==============================
Install & Setup Deoker :-
	1. Mac installation & setup
	2. Linux installation & setup
	3. Windows installation & setup

==============================
Docker Hub :-
	1. Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities. 
	2. You can also upload your own Docker built images to Docker hub.
	3. Docker hub has public as well as private repositories.

==============================
Docker process :-
	Dockerfile build a docker image and that image contains all the project code.
	We can run that image to create as many Docker containers as we want.
	Then this image can be uploaded on docker hub, from docker hub anyone can pull the image and build a container.

==============================
Docker images :- 
	Docker images are readonly templates used to create docker containers.
	Built by docker users.
	Stored in docker hub or local repositroies 

==============================
Docker repositories :-


==============================
Docker containers :-
	Isolated application platform.
	Contains everything needed to run the application.
	Built from one or more images.
