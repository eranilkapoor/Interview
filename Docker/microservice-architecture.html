Microservice Architecture :- The idea behind microservices is that some type of applications become easier to build and maintain when tey are broken down into smaller, composable pieces which work together. Each component developed seprately, and the application is then simply the sum of its consitituent components.

Example :- A online Shoping Service will be devide into multiple samll services like account service, product catalog, cart service & order service which can have its own database as well as common databases.

Major reasons to addopting the microservices :-
1. Esaier to build & maintain samll piece of services.
2. Less dependency so esaier to update.
3. High availablity and performance. 

Advantage of Microservice Architecture :-
1. Independent Development
2. Independent Deployment
3. Fault Isolation
4. Mixed Technology Stack
5. Granular Scaling
