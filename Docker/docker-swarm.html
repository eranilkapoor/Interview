Docker Swarm :- Docker Swarm is a technique to create and maintain a cluster of Docker Engines. Service deployed in any node can be accessed on other nodes in the same cluster.

Docker swarm is a cluster of machine, all running docker which provides scalable and reliable platform to run many containers.

With swarm, IT adminstrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.

Every swarm has al least one manager (Generally the one which is initialized first) and has many worker nodes under it.

Features :-

1. High Availablity of Services
2. Auto load-balancing
3. Decentralized access
4. Easy to Scale-up deployments
5. Rolling updates

Docker Swarm Commands :-

Initialize the swarm 	>> doker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip-addr>
						>> docker swarm join
						>> docker swarm join-token
						>> docker swarm leave
List Services 			>> docker service ls
List task of services 	>> docker service ps <name>
Create new Service 		>> docker service create <name> <image-name>
Remove service 			>> docker service rm <name>
Scale Services 			>> docker service scale <name>=5

List the nodes.         >> docker node ls
List services in nodes  >> docker node ps
Remove node 			>> docker node rm <id>
