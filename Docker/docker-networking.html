Goals of Docker Networking :-

1. Flexibility
2. Cross Platform
3. Scalability
4. Decentralized
5. User Friendly
6. Support

Container Network Model :-
Container Network Model (CNM) formalizes the steps required to provide networking for containers, while providing an abstraction that can be used to support multiple network drivers.
