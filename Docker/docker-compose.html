Docker Compose :-
==================
Docker compose makes it easier to configure and run applications made up of multiple containers.
Docker compose is used to rum multi-conatainer applications.
Each container will run a stand-alone application and it can communicate with other containers present in the same host.
Example :- MEAN Stack Application (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular & NodeJS) using different containers.

Example :- Imagine being able to define three containers.
	1. One running a web app.
	2. Another running MySQL.
	3. And third running a redis.
All in one YAML file and then running those three connected containers with a single command.


Syntax for run compose command
	1. docker-compose build
	2. docker-compose up
